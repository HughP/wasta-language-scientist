_Some changes and additions to Wasta Linux for the language and linguistic Scientist._

This script attempts to document some changes (mostily additions) to Wasta for the lingusitic Data Scientist.

The reasons we want to use wasta (and linux are the following): We feel that there is great value in being on the same operating system with the indegenous language speaking memebers of our team. This equality could happen with any operating system. However, with linux the cost of outfitting an entire team or part of a community with tools to make tools for their language is much lower than with OS X, or Windows. Wasta gives us the power of Ubuntu with the ease of access  connect with SIL Software systems.

This script endevors to bring the rest of what was forgtten for the modern interdisciplinary, digital humanities sensitive, anthroplogically aware linguist, loooking to enrich the lives and communities of minority language (and digitaly under-resourced) speakers.

Wasta has two GUI interfaces. 1. Unity which ships with Ubuntu and 2. Cinnimon, which is a Wasta innovation.

1. We might want to change somethings about the look and feel of our Wasta machine (this is more or less to bring over some features from OS X).
2. We might want some fonts and text processing tools
3. We might want to use some apache (Web) based tools for sharing our work globally or to work as a team on a local network. So, we will install some web devleopment tools.
4. We might want some access to iOS devices. These are really popular and we want to be able to connect them (and their sensors) as best as possible into our workflows.
5. We might want some SIL tools for doing some things "The SIL Way"... if there is one. (Bascially, SIL makes some awesome tools, but these are not all installed by default on Wasta.)
6. We might want some other tools to do linguistics. There are lots of tools for linguistics which are, sometimes not known about, and sometimes known about. We want to put them in the machine for ease of access to the end user.
7. We might want some data wrangling tools for our data. As a data scientist we are really keen to be able to collect good data, to detect patterns, in that data, and then also present that data in (often visual) compelling ways to our collegues, funders, and the communities we work with.
8. We might want some fun things to do... Because basically, the folks at Ubuntu don't have great tastes for intellegent games.
