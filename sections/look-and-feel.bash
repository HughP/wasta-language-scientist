# Script Name: look-and-feel.bash
# Author: Hugh Paterson III <email here>
# Version: 0.01
# License: GPL
# Dependencies: 64 bit Linux - we assume it is Wasta. Some installed packages might be 64 bit only nad some ppas might be added to Wasta already.
# OS: Designed to work on Wasta/Ubuntu read inline comments and README.md file.
# Target goal: Install some Linux tools which make the look and operational feel of Linux more OS X like.
# Expected use:  This script is designed to be triggered by another script.


### UX Tip: If things look and function like you are used to then adoption is quicker ###
# To get some features to make Wasta function more like a Mac OS X.

## To get quickview like functionality - where space bar can preview a file. (Allegelly this is also a feature in Unity, but the gloobus method has more file types supported than the Unity tool.)
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:nilarimogard/webupd8
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gloobus-preview
sudo apt-get install unoconv gnumeric
