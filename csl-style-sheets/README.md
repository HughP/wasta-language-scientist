#Style Sheets

These style sheets are grabbed for use in Zotero. Their upstream is in the CSL project, but for ease of import I have them in a folder here. These are all the linguistics and language realted style sheets.

It would be nice if SIL would also define its publication style sheets and then also publish them as CSL. -- Dream.
